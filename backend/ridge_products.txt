Producer: Menage a Trois Grapes: Zinfandel, Syrah and Moscato Where: California Country: USA Taste: fresh, ripe, jamlike fruit that is the calling card of California wine. Brimming with decadent blackberry and raspberry flavors, accented by warm notes of cherry vanilla. Forward, silky and soft, this delicious dalliance shows what emerges when you put three attractive, single, young grapes into one exquisite bottle. . Menage a Trois Red brings together three varietals: Zinfandel, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. To add complexity and retain character, each variety was fermented separately, then blended prior to bottling. Zinfandel is a saucy tease that brings blackberry and raspberry jam to the mix. Merlot, with its generous mouthfeel and red fruits, fits perfectly in the middle. The rich flavors and firm tannins of Cabernet Sauvignon make it the ideal candidate for the final layer of the trio."

Sip it neat, on the rocks, or mix it up with soda or ginger ale for a refreshing Jim Beam Highball. Jim Beam's extra aging creates an elegant, smooth and refined whiskey that pleases with every sip. This way of distilling is a family tradition that continues to this day after seven generations of master distillers. As the First Family of Bourbon, we were there when it all began. But weve never been the type to rest on our laurels. Always innovating, always taking bourbon to new heightsthats the Jim Beam way. And after more than two centuries, we have no intention of doing things any differently. Since we sold our first batch in 1795, each of our family distillers has found an opportunity to push our story forward and keep the tradition of Jacob Beam alive for the next generation of bourbon drinkers."

In 1975, Miller Lite established the light beer category and introduced the perfect balance of lightness and flavor nationally. Its a real Pilsner, brewed to have more color and taste with only 96 calories per 12oz. Since day one, our mission has been to deliver uncompromising quality through a great-tasting American-style Lager. Miller Lite has a golden color and deep flavor, yet is delicately balanced to be light on calories. Our unique process is more time consuming, but has earned us more gold medals for taste than any other light beer. Miller Lite is brewed for more taste with only 96 calories and 3.2g of carbs. In the summer, enjoy Miller Lite on a hot day, at a music festival or during holidays like the 4th of July, Memorial Day, Labor Day or Father's Day.  It's also the perfect beer to accompany sporting events such as Football, Basketball, Baseball and NASCAR. Tailgating or hosting a BBQ with friends? Make sure to have Miller Lite on hand. Don't forget to bring the original light beer to your favorite holiday party (and maybe one of our Ugly Holiday Sweaters) to enjoy with friends."

A Mexican tequila created with passion and pride in the land from which it comes, this easy-drinking tequila offers layered aromas of cooked agave, ripe banana, apple, chocolate, and cappuccino, along with vanilla, cinnamon, pumpkin, and clove. On the palate, honey maple, peaches and cream, white chocolate, and a thread of minerality segue to a pepper and toasted oak finish. The agave pinas used to make this straight-from-the-corazon tequila are not crushed but rather squeezed before being cooked in stone ovens. Double-distilled in alembic stills, this tequila alcohol is aged for three weeks in French oak red wine barrels for a richer, smoother finish that's a reinterpretation of tradition. Enjoy a Mi Campo tequila and tonic, a tequila Old Fashioned, or any number of the best tequila drinks, raising a toast to the spirit of modern Mexico. Salud!

The curious, yet marvelous, infusions of rose & cucumber imbue our spirit with its uniquely balanced flavor resulting in an unimpeachably smooth and distinct gin. The Hendricks Rickey is a beloved, refreshing and easy-to-make cocktail. However, Ms. Lesley Gracie, chooses to drink it with club soda, elderflower liqueur and garnished with 3 thinly sliced cucumber rounds. Hand-crafted on the Southwest coast of Scotland in the decidedly un-ginnish town of Girvan, tiny batches of only 500 lovely litres are produced at a time, which gives Ms. Lesley Gracie, our Master Distiller and the inventor of Hendricks Gin, greater control of her careful artistry. Hendricks Gin is created via an absurdly inefficient, yet quite glorious process. In essence, to make one gin, we first create two. One on an old-fashioned pot still, yielding a rich and intricate spirit. The other on along-necked Carter Head, producing a delicate, more refined spirit. Each still is infused with an unusual symphony of 11 botanicals. The gins from the two stills are then married together and graced with refreshing infusions of Rose and Cucumber. This odd method of making gin enables Hendricks to taste light, yet intriguingly complex. The result is a wondrously refreshing gin with a delightfully floral aroma, elevating any cocktail and all occasions. Escape the conventional, and embrace the delectable."

This is followed quickly by a vast array of fruit derived both from the spirit (smoked apricot, grapefruit peel) as well as the cask treatment (sloe gin, damson jam). The aroma is high toned, pungently floral and herbaceous, with subtle, balancing pops of minerality.  Palate: Darker (cocoa, molasses, burnt marshmallow) and spicier (cola, nutmeg, Tellicherry peppercorn) than the nose, an effect well-complemented by the cask treatment and rendered more complex by the savory and herbaceous themes running throughout.  Finish: A sweet and elegant signature of rose jelly, chestnut honey, and Pineau des Charantes that also features hazelnut, eucalyptus, and Corsican mint. With a few drops of spring water  An unexpected avalanche of orange and tropical notes of watermelon, lychee and vanilla on the nose."

Milagro Reposado is a 100% blue agave tequila which is rested in American oak barrels for 2-4 months. Every sip of Milagro Reposado delivers delicious notes of warm caramel and vanilla, and ends with surprising  yet subtle  notes of spice. Milagro Reposado tequila is best enjoyed neat, on the rocks or used to create your new favorite cocktail  like the Paloma Rosada! A bright & fresh take on a traditional Paloma with Milagro Reposado. Inspired by the upbeat energy and creativity of Mexico City, Milagro Tequila is hand-crafted in a process where tradition meets innovation. Our agave is sourced in the Jalisco Highlands, where the finest, sweetest blue agave in the world is cultivated. To extract all of the nuances of the precious agave flavor, the agave pinas are slow-roasted for 36 hours in traditional brick ovens. The extracted juice is then fermented and is finally distilled twice: first, in a pot still to retain the vibrant and mouthwatering flavors of the agave and second, in a column still to impart an absolutely exquisite smoothness that compares to the finest white spirits in the world. Please enjoy Milagro Tequila responsibly."

How about Sailor Jerry Mojito? We craft our rum by going out of our way to find the best Caribbean rums to make Sailor Jerry Spiced Rum. The ones that make the cut are blended together to create the ideal base for our unmatched recipe of natural spices. Our 92 proof spirit is historically accurate. In fact, the term proof comes from the method of reassuring sailors that their rum has not been watered down.

After the first distillation, the strength of the spirit is increased through a second distillation with a low wine still. A third distillation in the spirit still, creates a cut above 80% alcohol. This captures the heart of the spirit. Our coopers hand-select the finest former bourbon barrels in which to age our proper whiskey. Our spirit slowly ages developing through the years flavours of vanilla, honey and toasted wood.

The charred barrel transformed the clear liquid inside into an intense amber whiskey made rich with the flavors of the wood which we now recognize as Bourbon. Today, we honor his innovative spirit with Elijah Craig Rye: The first extra-aged Kentucky Straight Rye Whiskey to join Elijah Craigs award-winning lineup.

The taste is rounded with vanilla and sweet oak notes, with a fruity character that develops with time, all encompassed in a soft and lingering finish. Best enjoyed neat, on the rocks or with a splash of water to expand the flavor. The Balvenie is dedicated to the five rare crafts that are used to create The Balvenies distinctive taste. It is the only distillery that still grows its own barley, uses traditional floor maltings and keeps both coppersmiths and coopers on site  making The Balvenie one of the most handcrafted of malts. The Balvenie is a unique range of single malt whiskies produced in Dufftown, Scotlands Speyside region. Created by internationally renowned Malt Master David C. Stewart MBE, each variant in the range has its own unique taste, while still maintaining the recognizable undertones of the distinctively rich, smooth and honeyed character of The Balvenie.

Het toevoegen van fruit zorgde voor een nieuwe fermentatie in de eiken vaten. Adding fruits brought about a new fermentation in oak barrels. Na 8 tot 12 maanden bleven van de krieken enkel de pitten en pellen over en was de Kriekenlambiek klaar om gefilterd en gebotteld te worden. After 8 to 12 months of the cherries were the only seeds and peeling on the Kriekenlambiek and was ready to be filtered and bottled. Deze methode geeft een eerder zuur en minder fruitig bier. This method gives a more acidic and less fruity beer. Door de beperkte beschikbaarheid van de echte ""Schaarbeekse Krieken"" evenals om een meer fruitig en minder zuur bier te brouwen, ontwikkelde brouwerij Lindemans een unieke natuurlijke methode. Due to the limited availability of the real ""Skimmer Krieken"" as well as a more fruity and less acidic beer brewing, brewery Lindemans developed a unique natural method. Hierbij maakt ze gebruik van vers geperst kriekensap, niet geconcentreerd en ongezoet, dat gemengd wordt met zorgvuldig geselecteerde lambiek met een gewogen gemiddelde leeftijd van ten minste een jaar en waarvan de oudste gedurende ten minste drie jaar in houten vaten heeft gerijpt. Here, she uses fresh squeezed kriekensap not concentrated and not sweetened, which is mixed with carefully selected lambic with a weighted average age of at least a year and whose oldest for at least three years in wooden barrels has matured. Het sap wordt enige tijd in vaten gemacereerd met de lambiek voordat het mengsel afgevuld wordt op fles. The juice is some time in barrels carried by the lambic before the mixture is filled in the bottle. Typische gerechten met dit bier zijn ""boterhammen met plattekaas"" of ""konijn met kriek "". Typical dishes with this beer ""sandwiches with plattekaas"" or ""rabbit with Kriek."" Het kan zelfs als basis dienen voor kriek sorbet, of eenvoudig als aperitief gedronken worden. It can even serve as a basis for cherry sorbet, or simply drunk as an aperitif."

What you get is a rye that rides the line between spice and sweetness with finesse. Expect classic baking spice and golden apple on the nose, followed by layers of caramel, honey, and brown sugar on the palate. It finishes with a warm kiss of spice, mellow oak, and a whisper of faded fruit. Crafted grain-to-glass in Maryland and proofed with limestone-filtered spring water from a 1909 spring house, this rye honors its roots while raising the bar.

Mix it with ginger ale and lime for an effortless long drink. This one literally changed the way we think about bourbon, all because one man changed the way he thought about making it. Bill Samuels, Sr., wanted a whisky he would enjoy drinking. Never bitter or sharp, Maker's Mark is made with soft red winter wheat, instead of rye, for a one-of-a-kind, full-flavored bourbon that's approachably smooth. To ensure consistency, we still rotate every barrel by hand and age our bourbon to taste, not time. Just like Bill would have wanted. Once it's ready it's bottled at 90 proof, hand-dipped in our signature red wax. Just think of it as our seal of approval. Since its establishment, Maker's Mark has continually impressed critics, winning double gold at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition in 2020 and 2021."

Every step in its creation is a testament to the dedication and precision that defines this exceptional spirit. 1. Milling & Mashing The journey begins with the finest barley, meticulously processed through steeping, germination, and gentle air drying. Using a traditional roller mill, the malt barley is transformed into a fine grist, laying the foundation for what's to come. 2. Fermentation After mashing, the natural fermentation process unfolds, giving birth to the wash, essentially a beer with over 8% alcohol. This crucial stage sets the tone for the richness that Proper Twelve is known for. 3. Distillation Crafted through the traditional triple distillation method using copper pot stills, Proper Twelve's character is meticulously refined. The spirit undergoes successive distillations, gradually increasing in strength, resulting in a heart that's truly exceptional. 4. Maturation Our coopers, with a keen eye for quality, hand-select the finest former bourbon barrels for the maturation process. Proper Twelve slowly ages within these barrels, acquiring delightful notes of vanilla, honey, and toasted wood, making each sip a journey through time. 5. Blending At the heart of Proper No. Twelve lies the art of blending. Our Master Distiller meticulously selects casks that embody the rich character needed to craft this ultra-smooth whiskey. The result is a harmonious fusion of sweet Irish grain spirit and single malt Irish whiskey, creating a whiskey with unparalleled complexity. Elevate your spirits with Proper Twelve Irish Whiskey  a symphony of craftsmanship and flavor that stands as a true Irish treasure."

Crafted using high-quality, 100% blue weber agave, this 80-proof tequila liquor is the color of light straw with touches of silver sparkle. A tequila blanco created with passion and pride in the land from which it comes, this easy-drinking tequila offers layered aromas of cooked agave, banana, fresh coconut, almonds, sweet orange, and green apple along with hints of elegant vanilla. On the palate, orange blossom tea underscores threads of honey and sweet orange, balanced by subtle white pepper notes.

Each step in the process contributes to the exceptional quality that defines this renowned spirit. 1. Milling & Mashing The journey begins with the finest barley, carefully steeped, germinated, and gently air-dried. Utilizing a traditional roller mill, the malt barley transforms into a fine grist, setting the foundation for what's to come. 2. Fermentation Following the mashing stage, the natural fermentation process unfolds, giving rise to the wash  essentially a beer with over 8% alcohol. This critical phase establishes the richness for which Proper Twelve is celebrated. 3. Distillation Crafted through the traditional triple distillation method using copper pot stills, Proper Twelve's character is meticulously refined. Successive distillations, including a second distillation with a low wine still and a third distillation in the spirit still, elevate the spirit to a cut above 80% alcohol, capturing the true essence of the heart of the spirit. 4. Maturation Our coopers, with an eye for quality, hand-select the finest former bourbon barrels for the maturation process. Proper Twelve ages gracefully within these barrels, developing flavors of vanilla, honey, and toasted wood over the years, creating a whiskey of unparalleled depth. 5. Blending At the heart of Proper No. Twelve lies the art of blending.

Vibes with: red meat dishes and is excellent with spicy foods, along with grilled meats and vegetables. Enjoy chilled. . Additional Info: WINEMAKING: As the various varieties ripen at different times, they are harvested and vinified separately, with great emphasis being placed on selection of the bunches before crushing.  Alcoholic fermentation is carried out in contact with the skins at a temperature of no higher than 26 C, with a part of the berries being fermented whole to preserve and enhance their fruity aromas. A part of the must is stored chilled to prevent it from undergoing alcoholic fermentation and is then added to the blend to increase the sugar content. . Fabrizio Marinconz is the winemaker. Born and bred right in Trentino, it was only natural for Fabrizio to find a home at Cavit. He received his degree in Viticulture and Enology in 2005 from S. Michele allAdige Agricultural Institute and Hochschule Geisenheim (Germany) before joining Cavit in late 2006 as vineyard technician. This early experience working every day with the Cavit winegrowers in the vineyards gave him an incredible base to build his career as a winemaker. In 2010, he was promoted to join the winemaking team alongside chief winemaker, Anselmo Martini, until his retirement in 2020. Fabrizio was then given the key position of Associate Winemaker and is proudly responsible for the production of all the Cavit still wines."

Pour over ice and top up with tonic water. Garnish with thin slices of ginger to bring out the gin's unique herbal and citrus notes.

Sakura leaves and flowers are handpicked in spring, with Sencha and Gyokuro teas being plucked in summer. In fall it's time for the spicy Sansho pepper, and the zingy Yuzu fruit bursts into ripeness in winter.

Maker's Mark Classic Bourbon was carefully developed by sixth-generation distiller Bill Samuels Sr. to be just that. Still made to his unique recipe, this full-flavored bourbon is subtly woody with flavors of vanilla, caramel and fruit. It's easy to drink neat, and can pull its weight in a cocktail. Mix it with ginger ale and lime for an effortless long drink. This one literally changed the way we think about bourbon, all because one man changed the way he thought about making it. Bill Samuels, Sr., wanted a whisky he would enjoy drinking. Never bitter or sharp, Maker's Mark is made with soft red winter wheat, instead of rye, for a one-of-a-kind, full-flavored bourbon that's approachably smooth. To ensure consistency, we still rotate every barrel by hand and age our bourbon to taste, not time. Just like Bill would have wanted. Once it's ready it's bottled at 90 proof, hand-dipped in our signature red wax. Just think of it as our seal of approval. Since its establishment, Maker's Mark has continually impressed critics, winning double gold at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition in 2020 and 2021."

Prior to being coopered, the barrel wood is seasoned in open air, rain, wind, sun, and snow for eighteen months, softening the woods harsh tannins. The barrels are then slowly toasted and heavily charred to further enrich the woods desirable flavors.

A new champagne tasting experience that brings together pleasure, freshness and the free spirit of summer time. A gleaming vivid pink color in the glass with golden highlights. The wine shows a vibrant, fruity bouquet, with mainly scents of fragrant red berries and cherries: Morello cherry, lingonberry and cranberry. Nuances of juicy summer fruits: fig and nectarine with an appetizing note of grenadine. Luscious on the palate combing sweetness and firmness. The sweetness reminiscent of berries disperses and becomes lighter. A harmonious balance of fruitiness and freshness. A refreshing finish with a deliciously bittersweet note of pink grapefruit. Moet Ice Rose Imperial, served with 3 ice cubes in a large cabernet-style glass, can be mixed with ingredients that heighten its freshness and aromatic intensity incuding mint leaves, lime or white grapefruit zest, cucumber peel, a very thin slice of ginger or red fruits (strawberries, raspberries)."
