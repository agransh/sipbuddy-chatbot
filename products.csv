58af3c5001ff95231178c159,Donna Laura Ali Toscana Rosso 750ml,"The story of Donna Laura Wines is a nomadic discovery of heritage and matriarchal devotion as linear as the winding roads that weave through the hillsides and vineyards of Tuscany. The history follows vintner Lia Tolaini Banville from her birthplace in Canada to her ancestral home outside the city of Lucca, where at the age of six on her family's annual summer holiday, Lia met her Aunt Laura who would become a driving force in in her life. Laura was mother to three rough-and-tumble boys and immediately bonded with Lia. Thus began the tradition of yearly visits where during the warm summer days and nights Laura would instill in Lia an appreciation for Italian culture, history, music and most of all art. Laura's presence in Lia's life would inspire her as a mother, cook, vintner and businessperson and after graduating with degrees in art and economics and starting a family of her own, Lia would continue to visit her Aunt Laura with her own children growing this family bond. In 2004 an opportunity arose to write a new chapter in the story, this time in Castelnuovo Berardenga with the production of the Chianti wine label Donna Laura. A loving tribute to the woman whose lessons of family, tradition and honor would share double billing with Lia's own heritage. Roman gods Venus, Bacchus and Cupid personifying Lia's children adorn the labels of Donna Laura Wines, celebrating this legacy of devotion to family and affirming the adage 'Chi si volta, a chi si gira, sempre a casa va finire' - no matter where you go or turn you will always end up at home. This wine is made from predominantly Sangiovese, which contributes vibrant fruit and structure. A small amount of Cabernet Sauvignon is added to the blend for additional layers of complexity. After fermentation the wine spends one year in stainless steel before bottling.",https://capitalbeerwine.com/shop/product/donna-laura-ali-toscana-rosso/58af3c5001ff95231178c159?option-id=c41b94953c963f962fabf605995246b3dcc4064915ba84a309360f44b0203dd1&utm_source=googleshopping&utm_medium=feed,new,17.84 USD,,in_stock,https://cityhive-prod-cdn.cityhive.net/products/5b9194b8c979942a2c453de0/large.png?format=square,08054377050061,641,499676,Donna Laura,wine > red,3.5 lbs,750ml,750ml,Donna Laura,n,"Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon",red,,,,https://capitalbeerwine.com/cart?product-option-id=c41b94953c963f962fabf605995246b3dcc4064915ba84a309360f44b0203dd1

636d59a357890a63ef3516c0,Chateau de l'Escarelle 'Rumeurs' Rose 750ml,"Chateau l'Escarelle's 100 hectares of vines flourish in the midst of 1,000 hectares of stunning, protected countryside in the very heart of Provence. Less than an hour's drive east of Aix-en-Provence, the estate is famous for its beautifully aromatic and enticing dry Rose wines that are made from a blend of Grenache, Syrah, and Cinsault. The vines are planted in limestone soil on terraces separated by dry-stone walls at an altitude of up to 500 metres, naturally following the shape of Escarelle's hills and the Montagne de la Loube. This variation in altitude contributes to the terroir's special character, enabling the vinification of very expressive, aromatic wines. Yann Pineau, French businessman and environmental advocate, purchased the estate in 2014. Yann is passionate about wine and also deeply committed to preserving the unique natural environment of Chateau l'Escarelle. Since purchasing the estate, Yann has made a significant investment in the property by updating the winery and also initiated the process of converting the entire estate to organic farming. Escarelle's first certified organic wines will be released in 2021. Chateau l'Escarelle currently holds the Haute Valeur Environnementale certificate (HVE), France's most stringent environmental certificate. Valerie Maquet joined owner Yann Pineau ten years ago in creating and managing the Itancia Endowment Fund, an independent organization which campaigns on behalf of the environment. When Yann Pineau purchased Chateau LEscarelle in 2014, Valerie joined the new team with the aim of implementing all the sustainable practices supported by the Itancia Endowment Fund. Initially in charge of Sales & Marketing, Valerie sharpened her wine knowledge by learning from Patrick Lobier, winemaker at LEscarelle for more than 25 years.

After four years ageing in cellar, its style combines complexity, balance and distinction. With a powerful and attractive nose, it first delivers aromas of fruit (pear, mango ...) and then releases light flavours of honeysuckle and white jasmine, lingering on vanilla and brioche notes. Behind a frank and dynamic attack, the wine encompasses a nice harmony and a pleasant freshness, whilst preserving some structure.

This little addition, a mere 5%. introduces an element of earth and classic French garrigue more commonly associated with reds. But make no mistake, this is indeed the lip-smacking quaffer you'll want to enjoy on your porch on these beautiful spring days we've been enjoying, perhaps with a good read as we tick away these (hopefully) last remaining days of the pandemic.

56ca8d327562752ed52e1000,Pilsner Urquel 12oz,"Plzen in the Czech Republic was literally born to make beer. When King Wenceslas II of Bohemia founded the city in 1295, he granted its 260 households the right to make beer. For hundreds of years, this worked great. Yet as might be expect with this many home brewers, quality varied over time. It was easy to get beer but not so easy to get good beer. In 1838, several of the more enthusiastic brewers in town declared 36 barrels undrinkable and dumped them out in front of the town hall. This drove the brewing households to join forces and collectively build a brewery -- The Citizens Brewery of Plzen. The idea was to create a state of the art brewery to put in place a series of new beer making practices that were making their way across central Europe, such as the production of pale malt. Under the main building they dug a network of ice-cooled tunnels for another new technique called laagering (from the German 'lager'- to store). Four years later they revealed a golden clear, crisp, light-bodied beer that blew the doors off the dark and cloudy beers of the time. Pilsner Urquell is still brewed in the same brewery with the same soft Plzen water, saaz hops from Zatec, Czech barley from Moravia, and the same H-strain yeast. We still germinate and malt ourselves, and continue to triple-decoct our mash over open flames. Pilsner Urquell is the Worlds Original Pilsner. With aromas of fresh bread, hints of Saaz hops and honeysuckle, taste notes of caramel maltiness balanced by a distinct bitterness, and a nice creamy mouthfeel and smooth, refreshing finish, it is easy to see why the original pilsner is a great session beer. Excellent choice for craft beer and import beer drinkers looking for an authentic, easy-drinking beer. The light beer is perfect for any occasion, such as sporting events, daytime adult beverage activities, warm weather sessionabilty, barbeques, and food pairing occasions that compliment traditional European dishes, as well as neutral flavored salted snacks.",https://capitalbeerwine.com/shop/product/pilsner-urquel/56ca8d327562752ed52e1000?option-id=a41090d6942b41a900226b139cf034592aa51f5a548136ae4bddae112b2ce6c6&utm_source=googleshopping&utm_medium=feed,new,13.64 USD,,in_stock,https://cityhive-prod-cdn.cityhive.net/products/656b9b491a984f2ba9563014/large.png?format=square,00072311630016,1448,499676,Pilsner Urquell,beer > pilsner,3.5 lbs,354ml,750ml,Pilsner Urquell,n,,czech,,,,https://capitalbeerwine.com/cart?product-option-id=a41090d6942b41a900226b139cf034592aa51f5a548136ae4bddae112b2ce6c6

5521cef06561310003870000,Caymus Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon 750ml,"Caymus Vineyards remains 100% family-owned by the Wagners. Charlie, Lorna Belle, and Chuck worked together as a remarkable team for over 30 years building Caymus Cabernet. Today, Chuck, his two sons, Charlie and Joe, and one daughter, Jenny, have joined the family team. Farming grapes remain the priority with the family farming about 350 acres of choice Napa Valley land. The Wagners took the name Caymus from the Mexican land grant known as Rancho Caymus, given to George Yount in 1836, which encompassed what eventually became the town of Rutherford and much of the surrounding area. The Cabernet bottlings have aromas and flavors which can only be achieved through hang time a technique which chances the loss of crop if early winter sets in. Leaving the fruit to hang on the vine unusually long develops suppleness, increases color, and matures the tannins of the grapes. The wines are abundant in textural tannins yet soft as velvet. Crop thinning, allowing measured sunlight to reach the vines fruit zone, and waiting for increased ripeness are all part of our viticultural practices.

Pike Road Pinot Noir is made from 100% Willamette Valley fruit. Primarily sourced from six estate vineyard sites, Pike Road also includes smaller lots of Pinot Noir fruit grown by trusted partners here in the Willamette Valley. By integrating fruit from multiple locations, Pike Road gains in complexity. The 2018 Vintage 2018 was a vintage for rich, bold flavors in Willamette Valley wines. Starting hot and dry through the spring and summer, by September rain was a welcome relief. Cooler temperatures during harvest slowed ripening and increased hang-time. With multiple vineyards ripening simultaneously in October, our crew put in long hours at the end of crush. Their hard work has paid off with bold fruit-forward red wines and fresh, stone-fruited white wines that veer into the tropical. 2018 was a warm vintage that ended cool giving us wines with a captivating combination of flavors.",https://capitalbeerwine.com/shop/product/pike-road-willamette-pinot-noir/585d771539e21c69c0c9adc6?option-id=326e2c9262d02e4df517bf31af949d87756e0a5a4b5f3ce254c5ac011d78de48&utm_source=googleshopping&utm_medium=feed,new,23.09 USD,,in_stock,https://cityhive-prod-cdn.cityhive.net/products/618ea183a63d74723445c623/large.png?format=square,00083648000182,2110,499676,Pike Road,wine > red,3.5 lbs,750ml,750ml,Pike Road,n,Pinot Noir,red,,,,https://capitalbeerwine.com/cart?product-option-id=326e2c9262d02e4df517bf31af949d87756e0a5a4b5f3ce254c5ac011d78de48
